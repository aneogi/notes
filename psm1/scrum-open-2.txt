Feedback

Management has no active role in the actual product development through Scrum. However, management external to the Scrum team is incredibly important in setting the vision and strategy to guide the overall direction of the organization.

True or False: The purpose of a Sprint is to produce a done increment of working product.

Correct answer: A)
You chose: A)
Correct answer
A)
True

Question 9 of 30
What is the recommended size for a Development Team (within the Scrum Team)?

(choose the best answer)

Correct answer: B)

A)
Minimal 7
Correct answer
B)
3 to 9
 
C)
7 plus or minus 2
 
D)
9
Feedback

Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work. Fewer than three Development Team members decreases interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. More than nine members simply requires too much coordination.
Question 10 of 30
The CEO asks the Development Team to add a "very important" item to a Sprint that is in progress. What should the Development Team do?

The items selected for a Sprint have been selected as most valuable with the Product Owner. The items serve the Sprint's goal. No changes should be made that endanger the Sprint Goal.

Question 14 of 30
Who is required to attend the Daily Scrum?

(choose the best answer)

Correct answer: A)
You chose: A)
Note: This question displayed answer options in random order when taking this Test.

The Development Team.
 
B)
The Scrum team.
 
C)
The Development Team and Scrum Master.
 
D)
The Development Team and Product Owner.
 
E)
The Scrum Master and Product Owner.
Feedback

Only the people doing the work described on the Sprint Backlog need to inspect and adapt at the Daily Scrum.

Otherwise, the Scrum Master simply has to make sure the Development Team knows how to conduct a Daily Scrum and does so.
Question 15 of 30
When many Development Teams are working on a single product, what best describes the definition of "Done?"

(choose the best answer)

Correct answer: C)
You chose: C)
Note: This question displayed answer options in random order when taking this Test.
 
A)
Each Development Team defines and uses its own. The differences are discussed and reconciled during a hardening Sprint.
 
B)
Each Development Team uses its own but must make their definition clear to all other teams so the differences are known.
Correct answer
C)
All Development Teams must have a definition of "Done" that makes their combined work potentially releasable.
 
D)
It depends.
Feedback

Scrum requires an Increment to be releasable. This is an Increment of product. Many teams working on a single product are expected to deliver such an Increment.
Question 16 of 30
Who creates the definition of "Done"?

(choose the best answer)

Correct answer: A)
You chose: B)
Note: This question displayed answer options in random order when taking this Test.
Missed correct answer
A)
The development organization (or Development Team if none is available from the development organization)
Incorrect answer
B)
The Scrum Team, in a collaborative effort where the result is the common denominator of all members' definitions
 
C)
The Product Owner as he/she is responsible for the product's success
 
D)
The Scrum Master as he/she is responsible for the Development Team's productivity
Feedback

If the definition of "done" is part of the conventions, standards or guidelines of the development organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. The Development Team of the Scrum Team can complement it with elements specific for the product or context.
If "done" for an increment is not a convention of the development organization, the Development Team of the Scrum Team must define a definition of "done" appropriate for the product.
Question 17 of 30
True or False: When multiple teams work together on the same product, each team should maintain a separate Product Backlog.

Correct answer: B)
You chose: B)
 
A)
True
Correct answer
B)
False
Feedback

Products have one Product Backlog, regardless of how many teams are used. Any other setup makes it difficult for the Development Team to determine what it should work on.
Question 18 of 30
When does a Development Team member become the sole owner of a Sprint Backlog item?

(choose the best answer)

Correct answer: B)
You chose: B)
Note: This question displayed answer options in random order when taking this Test.
 
A)
At the Sprint planning meeting.
Correct answer
B)
Never. All Sprint Backlog Items are "owned" by the entire Development Team, even though each one may be implemented by an individual development team member.
 
C)
Whenever a team member can accommodate more work.
 
D)
During the Daily Scrum.
Feedback

Sprint Backlog and all of its items are collectively owned by the Development Team. No individual team member can claim ownership over an item as this would block communication and collaboration.
