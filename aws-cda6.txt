Your company has a SOAP service that receives requests in XML. The service is going to be placed behind the API gateway service. Which of the following must be done to ensure that requests made to the API gateway service can be consumed by the SOAP service?

Explanation
The AWS Documentation mentions the followingIn API Gateway, an API's method request can take a payload in a different format from the corresponding integration request payload, as required in the backend. Similarly, the backend may return an integration response payload different from the method response payload, as expected by the frontend. API Gateway lets you use mapping templates to map the payload from a method request to the corresponding integration request and from an integration response to the corresponding method response.A mapping template is a script expressed in Velocity Template Language (VTL) and applied to the payload using JSONPath expressions. The payload can have a data model according to the JSON schema draft 4. You must define the model in order to have API Gateway to generate a SDK or to enable basic request validation for your API. You do not have to define any model to create a mapping template. However, a model can help you create a template because API Gateway will generate a template blueprint based on a provided model.Option B is incorrect since this is used to customize gateway responsesOption C is incorrect since this is used specifically for binary workloadsOption D is incorrect since this is used for use within a VPCFor more information on models and mappings, please refer to the below URLhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/models-mappings.htmlThe correct answer is: Create a mapping template

Explanation
The AWS Documentation mentions the followingDAX is a DynamoDB-compatible caching service that enables you to benefit from fast in-memory performance for demanding applications. DAX addresses three core scenarios:1.       As an in-memory cache, DAX reduces the response times of eventually-consistent read workloads by an order of magnitude, from single-digit milliseconds to microseconds.2.       DAX reduces operational and application complexity by providing a managed service that is API-compatible with Amazon DynamoDB, and thus requires only minimal functional changes to use with an existing application.3.       For read-heavy or bursty workloads, DAX provides increased throughput and potential operational cost savings by reducing the need to over-provision read capacity units. This is especially beneficial for applications that require repeated reads for individual keys.Option A is incorrect since this is good when you have unpredictable workloadsOption B is incorrect since this is good for disaster recovery scenariosOption C is incorrect since this is good to stream data to other sourcesFor more information on DynamoDB Accelerator, please refer to the below linkhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DAX.htmlThe correct answer is: Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator
