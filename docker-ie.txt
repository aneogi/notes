---------------------------------- Working with Dockerfile ----------------------------------

1. Building images using a dockerfile
	(i) Create a Dockerfile:
			FROM oraclelinux:6.6
			MAINTAINER A N Other <aneogi13@gmail.com>
			RUN sed -i -e '/^\[main\]/aproxy=http://proxy.mydom.com:80' /etc/yum.conf
			RUN yum -y install httpd
			RUN echo "HTTP server is running on port guest" > /var/www/html/index.html
			EXPOSE 80
			ENTRYPOINT /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND
	(ii) docker build -t my_server .
			==> Since the oraclelinux images is not present therefore the image is getting downloaded. Then the next the steps are getting executed.
	(iii) docker run -d --name myguest2 -P oraclelinux
			==> If the image was not installed previously then this command will download the image and run it.

2. Building an Apache image
	(i) docker rmi <<httpd_image_id>>
			==> Delete existing httpd image.
	(ii)
