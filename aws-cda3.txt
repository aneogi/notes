A security system monitors 3000 cameras saving image metadata every 30 seconds to an Amazon DynamoDB. Each sample involves writing 256 bytes of data and the writes are evenly distributed over time.How much write throughput is required for the target table. Choose an answer from the options below

Explanation
When we round off the item size to 1KB, we get 1 write per item. Since there are 3000 cameras saving data every 30 seconds , means that there are 3000 writes per 30 seconds and (3000/30) = 100 writes per second.

Question 71: Incorrect
Can data be saved when a stack is deleted in Cloudformation? Choose the correct answer from the options below

Explanation
AWS CloudFormation allows you to define deletion policies for resources in the template. You can specify that snapshots be created for Amazon EBS volumes or Amazon RDS database instances before they are deleted. You can also specify that a resource should be preserved and not deleted when the stack is deleted. This is useful for preserving Amazon S3 buckets when the stack is deleted.

Question 101: Incorrect
A corporate web application is deployed within an Amazon VPC, and is connected to the corporate data center via IPSec VPN. The application must authenticate against the on-premise LDAP server. Once authenticated, logged-in users can only access an S3 keyspace specific to the user. Which two approaches can satisfy the objectives?Choose 2 answers from the options below

Explanation
If you already manage user identities outside of AWS, you can use IAM identity providers instead of creating IAM users in your AWS account. With an identity provider , you can manage your user identities outside of AWS and give these external user identities permissions to use AWS resources in your account. This is useful if your organization already has its own identity system, such as a corporate user directory. It is also useful if you are creating a mobile app or web application that requires access to AWS resources.Option B is incorrect as it Needs to authenticate against LDAP and not IAM.Option C is incorrect as Need to authenticate with LDAPOption D is incorrect as Can’t login to IAM using LDAP credentialsFor more information on identity providers please visit the below link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html
Question 104: Incorrect
Which statements about DynamoDB are true? Choose 2 answers from the options below

Explanation
Optimistic locking is a strategy to ensure that the client-side item that you are updating (or deleting) is the same as the item in DynamoDB. If you use this strategy, then your database writes are protected from being overwritten by the writes of others — and vice-versa To help clients coordinate writes to data items, DynamoDB supports conditional writes for PutItem, DeleteItem, and UpdateItem operations. With a conditional write, an operation succeeds only if the item attributes meet one or more expected conditions; otherwise it returns an error For more information on working with items , please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html
Question 107: Incorrect
How can you secure data at rest on an EBS volume? Choose an answer from the options below

Explanation

Question 115: Incorrect
The only SNS notification event supported by S3 is S3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject. Choose the correct answer from the options below

Explanation
Currently, Amazon S3 can publish the following events:A new object created event—Amazon S3 supports multiple APIs to create objects. You can request notification when only a specific API is used (e.g., s3:ObjectCreated:Put) or you can use a wildcard (e.g., s3:ObjectCreated:*) to request notification when an object is created regardless of the API used.An object removal event—Amazon S3 supports deletes of versioned and unversioned objects. You can request notification when an object is deleted or a versioned object is permanently deleted by using the s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete event type. Or you can request notification when a delete marker is created for a versioned object by usings3:ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated. You can also use a wildcards3:ObjectRemoved:* to request notification anytime an object is deleted.A Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) object lost event—Amazon S3 sends a notification message when it detects that an object of the RRS storage class has been lost.For more information on S3 event notifications please visit the below link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html
