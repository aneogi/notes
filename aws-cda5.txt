Your application currently points to several Lambda functions in AWS. A change is being made to one of the Lambda functions. You need to ensure that application traffic is shifted slowly from one Lambda function to the other. Which of the following steps would you carry out?

Explanation
This is mentioned in the AWS DocumentationBy default, an alias points to a single Lambda function version. When the alias is updated to point to a different function version, incoming request traffic in turn instantly points to the updated version. This exposes that alias to any potential instabilities introduced by the new version. To minimize this impact, you can implement the routing-config parameter of the Lambda alias that allows you to point to two different versions of the Lambda function and dictate what percentage of incoming traffic is sent to each version.Options C and D are incorrect since you need to use ALIAS for this purpose.Option E is incorrect. Because A & B are the correct ways to achieve the requirement.For more information on shifting traffic using ALIAS , please refer to the below URLhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-traffic-shifting-using-aliases.htmlThe correct answers are: Create an ALIAS with the –routing-config parameter, Update the ALIAS with the –routing-config parameter

Explanation
The AWS Documentation mentions the followingSetting Up AWS X-Ray with LambdaFollowing, you can find detailed information on how to set up X-Ray with Lambda.Before You BeginTo enable tracing on your Lambda function using the Lambda CLI, you must first add tracing permissions to your function's execution role. To do so, take the following steps:Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.Find the execution role for your Lambda function.Attach the following managed policy: AWSXrayWriteOnlyAccessOption A is incorrect since this is used if you need to use X-Ray with an application which is hosted on an EC2 InstanceOption B is incorrect since this is not required to begin using the X-Ray service with AWS LambdaOption D is incorrect since the permissions need to be assigned the other way around.For more information on enabling X-Ray with AWS Lambda , please refer to the below URLhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/enabling-x-ray.htmlThe correct answer is: Ensure that the IAM Role assigned to the Lambda function has access to the X-Ray service


Question 73: Incorrect
An application is currently accessing a DynamoDB table. Currently the tables queries are performing well. Changes have been made to the application and now the performance of the application is starting to degrade. After looking at the changes , you see that the queries are making use of an attribute which is not the partition key? Which of the following would be the adequate change to make to resolve the issue?

Explanation
The AWS Documentation mentions the followingAmazon DynamoDB provides fast access to items in a table by specifying primary key values. However, many applications might benefit from having one or more secondary (or alternate) keys available, to allow efficient access to data with attributes other than the primary key. To address this, you can create one or more secondary indexes on a table, and issue Query or Scan requests against these indexes.A secondary index is a data structure that contains a subset of attributes from a table, along with an alternate key to support Query operations. You can retrieve data from the index using a Query, in much the same way as you use Query with a table. A table can have multiple secondary indexes, which gives your applications access to many different query patterns.Option B , although possible , is not the ideal approach to change the application code.Option C is used to disaster recovery scenariosOption D is not right , because we don’t know if this would solve the issue in the long runFor more information on Secondary Indexes , please refer to the below URLhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SecondaryIndexes.htmlThe correct answer is: Add an index for the DynamoDB table


Question 75: Incorrect
You have defined some custom policies in AWS. You need to test out the permissions assigned to those policies. Which of the following can be used for this purpose via the CLI? Choose 2 answers from the options given below

Explanation
This is mentioned in the AWS DocumentationPolicy simulator commands typically require calling API operations to do two things:1. Evaluate the policies and return the list of context keys that they reference. You need to know what context keys are referenced so that you can supply values for them in the next step.2. Simulate the policies, providing a list of actions, resources, and context keys that are used during the simulation.Because of the right command used in the documentation, all other options are incorrectFor more information on policy simulation , please refer to the below URLhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.htmlThe correct answers are: Get the context keys first, Use the aws iam simulate-custom-policy command


Question 76: Incorrect

Explanation
Options B and D are incorrect because you will not use the Customer Key directly to encrypt and decrypt data.The AWS Documentation mentions the followingWe recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your application:1. Use this operation (GenerateDataKey) to get a data encryption key.2. Use the plaintext data encryption key (returned in the Plaintext field of the response) to encrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.3. Store the encrypted data key (returned in the CiphertextBlob field of the response) alongside the locally encrypted data.For more information on generating data key , please refer to the below URLhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKey.htmlThe correct answers are: Use the GenerateDataKey to get the data key to encrypt the data, Delete the plaintext data encryption key after the data is encrypted

You are developing an application which will make use of Kinesis Firehose for streaming the records onto the Simple Storage Service. You company policy mandates that all data needs to be encrypted at rest. How can you achieve this with Kinesis Firehose? Choose 2 answers for the options given below.

Explanation
This is given in the AWS DocumentationIf you have sensitive data, you can enable server-side data encryption when you use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. However, this is only possible if you use a Kinesis stream as your data source. When you configure a Kinesis stream as the data source of a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, Kinesis Data Firehose no longer stores the data at rest. Instead, the data is stored in the Kinesis stream.Options B and C are invalid because this is used for encrypting data in transitFor more information on Data encryption with Kinesis Firehose , please refer to the below URLhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/encryption.htmlThe correct answers are: Enable Encryption for a Kinesis Data Firehose, Ensure that Kinesis streams are used to transfer the data from the producers


Question 87: Incorrect
You’re currently working with a table in DynamoDB. Your program has inserted a number of rows in the table. You now need to read the data from the table and only retrieve a certain number of attributes in the query. Which of the following would you use for this purpose?

Explanation
The AWS Documentation mentions the followingTo read data from a table, you use operations such as GetItem, Query, or Scan. DynamoDB returns all of the item attributes by default. To get just some, rather than all of the attributes, use a projection expression.A projection expression is a string that identifies the attributes you want. To retrieve a single attribute, specify its name. For multiple attributes, the names must be comma-separated.Options A and B are incorrect since Projection Expression are available in both the scan and query operationOption D is invalid since you need to use the Projection ExpressionFor more information on projection expressions, please refer to the below URLhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.ProjectionExpressions.htmlThe correct answer is: Use the Projection Expression


Question 97: Incorrect

Question 101: Incorrect
You’ve just started developing an application on your On-premise network. This application will interact with the Simple Storage Service and some DynamoDB tables. How would you as the developer ensure that your SDK can interact with the AWS services on the cloud?

Explanation
Options A and B are incorrect since we need to use AWS Access keys during development and not IAM RolesOption D is incorrect since we should not be generating a security token to interact with the various AWS services during the development phase.When working on development, you need to use the AWS Access keys to work with the AWS ResourcesThe AWS Documentation additionally mentions the followingYou use different types of security credentials depending on how you interact with AWS. For example, you use a user name and password to sign in to the AWS Management Console. You use access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS API operations.For more information on usage of credentials in AWS , please refer to the below linkhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.htmlThe correct answer is: Create an IAM User , generate the access keys. Use the Access keys from within your program.


Question 106: Incorrect
An application currently makes use of DynamoDB tables. There is a requirement that a user can only view certain items in the table. How can this be accomplished?

Explanation
The AWS Documentation mentions this specific use caseHide information so that only a subset of attributes are visible to the user. An example might be an app that displays flight data for nearby airports, based on the user's location. Airline names, arrival and departure times, and flight numbers are all displayed. However, attributes such as pilot names or the number of passengers are hidden, as shown in the following illustration:To implement this kind of fine-grained access control, you write an IAM permissions policy that specifies conditions for accessing security credentials and the associated permissions. You then apply the policy to IAM users, groups, or roles that you create using the IAM console. Your IAM policy can restrict access to individual items in a table, access to the attributes in those items, or both at the same time.All other options are invalid since the right approach is to use IAM polices with specific conditionsFor more information on specifying conditions , please refer to the below URLhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/specifying-conditions.htmlThe correct answer is: Use IAM polices with specific conditions


Question 110: Incorrect
You’ve created a local Java based Lambda function. You then package and upload the function to AWS. You try to run the function with the default settings , but the function does not run as expected. Which of the following could be the reasons for the issue? Choose 2 answers from the options given below.

Explanation
Since the function is created with the default settings , the timeout for the function would be 3 seconds and the memory would default to 128 MB. For a Java based function, this would be too less. Hence you need to ensure the right settings are put in place for the function.Q: How are compute resources assigned to an AWS Lambda function?In the AWS Lambda resource model, you choose the amount of memory you want for your function, and are allocated proportional CPU power and other resources. For example, choosing 256MB of memory allocates approximately twice as much CPU power to your Lambda function as requesting 128MB of memory and half as much CPU power as choosing 512MB of memory. You can set your memory in 64MB increments from 128MB to 1.5GB.Option A is invalid since the name is not a reason for the function not workingOption B is invalid since the CPU is allocated by AWS automatically.For more information on creating a function , please refer to the below URLhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/get-started-create-function.htmlThe correct answers are: The amount of memory assigned to the function is not enough., The timeout specified for the function is too less.


Question 112: Incorrect
Your application must write to an SQS queue. Your corporate security policies require that AWS credentials are always encrypted and are rotated at least once a week. How can you securely provide credentials that allow your application to write to the queue?

Explanation
This is clearly mentioned in the AWS DocumentationIAM Roles for Amazon EC2Applications must sign their API requests with AWS credentials. Therefore, if you are an application developer, you need a strategy for managing credentials for your applications that run on EC2 instances. For example, you can securely distribute your AWS credentials to the instances, enabling the applications on those instances to use your credentials to sign requests, while protecting your credentials from other users. However, it's challenging to securely distribute credentials to each instance, especially those that AWS creates on your behalf, such as Spot Instances or instances in Auto Scaling groups. You must also be able to update the credentials on each instance when you rotate your AWS credentials.We designed IAM roles so that your applications can securely make API requests from your instances, without requiring you to manage the security credentials that the applications use. Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials, you can delegate permission to make API requests using IAM roles as follows:Create an IAM role.Define which accounts or AWS services can assume the role.Define which API actions and resources the application can use after assuming the role.Specify the role when you launch your instance, or attach the role to a running or stopped instance.Have the application retrieve a set of temporary credentials and use them.All other options are invalid because you should not use Access Keys , this is the recommended best practise.For more information on IAM Roles , please refer to the below URLhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.htmlThe correct answer is: Launch the application's Amazon EC2 instance with an IAM role.
