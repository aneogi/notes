You have just set up a push notification service to send a message to an app installed on a device with the Apple Push Notification Service. It seems to work fine. You now want to send a message to an app installed on devices for multiple platforms, those being the Apple Push Notification Service(APNS) and Google Cloud Messaging for Android (GCM). What do you need to do first for this to be successful? Choose the correct answer from the options below

Explanation
For Amazon SNS to send notification messages to mobile endpoints, whether it is direct or with subscriptions to a topic, you first need to register the app with AWS. To register your mobile app with AWS, enter a name to represent your app, select the platform that will be supported, and provide your credentials for the notification service platform. After the app is registered with AWS, the next step is to create an endpoint for the app and mobile device. The endpoint is then used by Amazon SNS for sending notification messages to the app and device. For more information on SNS, please refer to the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-send-register.html
Question 7: Incorrect

Question 9: Incorrect
You are writing an AWS CloudFormation Template to create a static S3 website configuration. The resources section of this template will be used for access control of the bucket and is defined in the 5th line of the below code snippet. What should the value of "AccessControl" be so that the owner of the bucket gets full control and all users get READ access only."Resources" : {     "S3Bucket" : {            "Type" : "AWS::S3::Bucket",             "Properties" : {                     "AccessControl" : "ANSWER TO THE QUESTION",                      "BucketName": { "Ref" : "BucketName" },                      "WebsiteConfiguration" : {                                "IndexDocument" : "index.html",                                "ErrorDocument" : "error.html"                        }             }  }

Explanation
Since the question states that all users need read access, then by default we need to assign the public read permissionFor static website, it needs to be publicly readable only permissions for all users to access the site.For more information refer to AWS documentation @ URL:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/quickref-s3.html#scenario-s3-bucket-websiteProperty AccessControl should be set to canned ACL PublicRead which grants FULL_CONTROL to the owner and READ access to AllUsers group.Please review the section on Canned ACLs from Access Control List (ACL) Overview of Amazon S3 Developer Guide:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl
Question 20: Incorrect
Company B has many users updating the same table. At times it is not uncommon for multiple users to update the same item and attribute of an item at the same time. If user A calls an item in a table to update an attribute at the same time as user B and user B updates the table first, what can we deploy in DynamoDB to ensure User A is not updating an item that was updated since User A's table read? Choose the correct answer from the options below.

Explanation
To help clients coordinate writes to data items, DynamoDB supports conditional writes for PutItem, DeleteItem, and UpdateItem operations. With a conditional write, an operation succeeds only if the item attributes meet one or more expected conditions; otherwise it returns an error For more information on working with items , please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html
Question 32: Incorrect
For best performance when retrieving data from a table, what "type" of API call should you perform? Choose the correct answer from the options below.

Explanation
A Query operation uses the primary key of a table or a secondary index to directly access items from that table or index. Use the KeyConditionExpression parameter to provide a specific value for the partition key. The Queryoperation will return all of the items from the table or index with that partition key value. You can optionally narrow the scope of the Query operation by specifying a sort key value and a comparison operator in KeyConditionExpression. You can use the ScanIndexForward parameter to get results in forward or reverse order, by sort key. For more information on DynamoDB Query, please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Query.html
Question 33: Incorrect
You receive a call from a potential client who explains that one of the many services they offer is a website running on a t2.micro EC2 instance where users can submit requests for customized e-cards to be sent to their friends and family. The e-card website administrator was on a cruise and was shocked when he returned to the office in mid-January to find hundreds of angry emails complaining that customers’ loved ones had not received their Christmas cards. He also had several emails from CloudWatch alerting him that the SQS queue for the e-card application had grown to over 500 messages on December 25th. You investigate and find that the problem was caused by a crashed EC2 instance which serves as an application server. What do you advise your client to do first? Choose the correct answer from the options below

Explanation
The maximum retention period for SQS messages is 14 days, hence all the messages would have been lost by the mid of Jan. For more information on SQS please visit the below link: https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/faqs/

The following code snippet is the resources section of a CloudFormation template that you have written."Resources" : {    "EC2Instance" : {        "Type" : "AWS::EC2::Instance",         "Properties" : {             "InstanceType" : { "Ref" : "InstanceType" },              "SecurityGroups" : [ { "Ref" : "InstanceSecurityGroup" } ],               "KeyName" : { "Ref" : "KeyName" },               "ImageId" : { "Fn::FindInMap" : [ "AWSRegionArch2AMI", { "Ref" : "AWS::Region" },                { "Fn::FindInMap" : [ "AWSInstanceType2Arch", { "Ref" : "InstanceType" }, "Arch" ] }               ]        }   }},You have used the reference function to define your instance type as follows."InstanceType" : { "Ref" : "InstanceType" },The referencing function is referencing the instance type. Where is this value most likely coming from?

Explanation
The Instance type is mostly coming from the parameters section. Within the same template, you can use the Ref intrinsic function to specify the parameter value in other parts of the template. The following snippet uses the InstanceTypeParameter parameter to specify the instance type for an EC2 instance resource For more information on the Instrinsic reference function URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html
Question 85: Incorrect
Company B has a DynamoDB table where the average item size is 10KB. Company B anticipates the application will read 100 items from the table per second using eventually consistent reads. How much read capacity throughput should they provision? Choose the correct answer from the options below.

Explanation
For read capacity, the rule is to divide the item size by 4KB. Hence we need to divide 10 by 4 which gives us 3 to the nearest 4KB. Since we are reading 100 items per second, we need to multiply 100*3 =300. Since it is eventual consistency , we need to divide by 2 which gives us 150.

Question 91: Incorrect
What is the default timeout for visibility queue in SQS in seconds? Choose the correct answer from the options below
