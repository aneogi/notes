Question 32: Incorrect
For best performance when retrieving data from a table, what "type" of API call should you perform? Choose the correct answer from the options below.

Explanation
A Query operation uses the primary key of a table or a secondary index to directly access items from that table or index. Use the KeyConditionExpression parameter to provide a specific value for the partition key. The Queryoperation will return all of the items from the table or index with that partition key value. You can optionally narrow the scope of the Query operation by specifying a sort key value and a comparison operator in KeyConditionExpression. You can use the ScanIndexForward parameter to get results in forward or reverse order, by sort key. For more information on DynamoDB Query, please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Query.html

Question 85: Incorrect
Company B has a DynamoDB table where the average item size is 10KB. Company B anticipates the application will read 100 items from the table per second using eventually consistent reads. How much read capacity throughput should they provision? Choose the correct answer from the options below.

Explanation
For read capacity, the rule is to divide the item size by 4KB. Hence we need to divide 10 by 4 which gives us 3 to the nearest 4KB. Since we are reading 100 items per second, we need to multiply 100*3 =300. Since it is eventual consistency , we need to divide by 2 which gives us 150.

Explanation
When you use AWS-specific parameter types, anyone who uses your template to create or update a stack must specify existing AWS values that are in his account and in the region for the current stack. AWS-specific parameter types help ensure that input values for these types exist and are correct before AWS CloudFormation creates or updates any resources. For example, if you use the AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName parameter type, AWS CloudFormation validates the input value against users' existing key pair names before it creates any resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances.

A corporate web application is deployed within an Amazon VPC, and is connected to the corporate data center via IPSec VPN. The application must authenticate against the on-premise LDAP server. Once authenticated, logged-in users can only access an S3 keyspace specific to the user. Choose 2 answer from the options below

Explanation
If you already manage user identities outside of AWS, you can use IAM identity providers instead of creating IAM users in your AWS account. With an identity provider , you can manage your user identities outside of AWS and give these external user identities permissions to use AWS resources in your account. This is useful if your organization already has its own identity system, such as a corporate user directory. It is also useful if you are creating a mobile app or web application that requires access to AWS resources. For more information on identity providers please visit the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html

Question 119: Incorrect
You define the following S3 bucket policy to grant users access to your bucket, but the S3 bucket policy editor will not allow you to submit it. Why is this policy not working? Choose the correct answer from the options below{   "Id": "Policy1441839160967",   "Version": "2012-10-17",   "Statement": [    {         "Sid": "Stmt1441839157568",         "Action": [             "s3:ListBucket"          ],        "Effect": "Allow",        "Resource": "arn:AWS:s3:::demo.testbucket.2 "     }  ]}

Explanation
In its most basic sense, a policy contains the following elements:Resources – Buckets and objects are the Amazon S3 resources for which you can allow or deny permissions. In a policy, you use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to identify the resource.Actions – For each resource, Amazon S3 supports a set of operations. You identify resource operations you will allow (or deny) by using action keywordsEffect – What the effect will be when the user requests the specific action—this can be either allow or deny.Principal – The account or user who is allowed access to the actions and resources in the statement. You specify a principal only in a bucket policy. It is the user, account, service, or other entity who is the recipient of this permission. In a user policy, the user to which the policy is attached is the implicit principal.For more information on bucket policies please visit the below link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-policy-language-overview.html

Question 129: Incorrect
What is the best method for maintaining application session state when using an Elastic Load Balancer? Choose the correct answer from the options below

Explanation
Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy and run Memcached or Redis protocol-compliant server nodes in the cloud. Amazon ElastiCache improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from a fast, managed, in-memory system, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases. The service simplifies and offloads the management, monitoring and operation of in-memory environments, enabling your engineering resources to focus on developing applications. Using Amazon ElastiCache, you can not only improve load and response times to user actions and queries, but also reduce the cost associated with scaling web applications. As an example for application session stickiness using Elastic cache, please refer to the below link: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/elasticache-as-an-asp-net-session-store/
